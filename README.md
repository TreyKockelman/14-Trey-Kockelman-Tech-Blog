  ## Description
  The purpose of this project is to provide a blog website for users to put blogs and comment on others posts. There were a lot of challenges with this. One of the challenges was getting the project deployed to railway. I had issues getting the data seeded and on the website after deployment. Another issue was connecting the front end and back end. The back end routes were all set up fairly easily but connecting them to the front end proved to be difficult with the buttons.
